# break down problem: import game data; randomly select an entry from game_data list of dictionary entries and compare to another item; get user to select which one has a higher follower count.  If user choses wrong, game ends, if correct, 2nd item becomes the first item and is comapred to a new list item.
# make a to do list: import game data, assign random list items to variables, display them in the correct manner, make fxn that replaces first list item if user is correct, figure out a way to score
